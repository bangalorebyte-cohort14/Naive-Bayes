Read pages 103-115 in Course in Machine Learning and also this is a great intuitive explanation of Bayesian analyses: https://arbital.com/p/bayes_frequency_diagram/?l=55z&pathId=41477


- Take the default dataset and sample only 2000 datapoints (maintainig class distribution) and do the following:
  1) fit the 2000 points using only Gaussian Nb and print confusion matrix
  2) fit the 2000 points using two models: Gaussian NB and BernoulliNB and multiply their probabilites to get the final output for each row. Print the confusion matrix here as well.
